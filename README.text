Note to self.

Unfortunately, I am unable to install variety from the source.
Maybe missing dependencies, etc?

In any case, a viable alternative is simply to install using
'sudo apt install variety'

Then, make custom changes to the code at:
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/variety/

to perform diagnostics, etc.
